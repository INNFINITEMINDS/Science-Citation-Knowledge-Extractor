['\n        \n          Background\n          HIV-1 replication results in mitochondrial damage that is enhanced during antiretroviral therapy (ART). The onset of HIV-1 replication is regulated by viral protein Tat, a 101-residue protein codified by two exons that elongates viral transcripts.

Representative results were confirmed in PBLs transiently expressing Tat101 and in HIV-infected Jurkat cells. The intracellular expression of Tat101 induced the deregulation of metabolism and cytoskeletal proteins which remodeled the function and distribution of mitochondria.

HIV-1 replication results in the chronic activation of the immune system and consequently in premature immunosenescence [2]. During normal aging, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) accumulate mutations induced through the direct exposition to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deficient repair systems [3, 4]. Accordingly, T CD4+ lymphocytes from naïve HIV-1 infected patients show mtDNA depletion along with impaired activity of the respiratory chain components, enhanced oxidative damage and decrease mitochondrial transmembrane potential (∆ψm) [5, 6]. These alterations may be explained by a deregulated expression of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded proteins such as Prohibitin, Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) and complex-I subunit NDUF6 [7, 8]. Furthermore, it is well-known that the antiretroviral treatment (ART) against HIV-1, in particular nucleoside-analogue inhibitors (NRTIs), induces mitochondrial toxicity [9, 10] due to the inhibition of mtDNA polymerase γ [11]. In summary, HIV-1 infection triggers mitochondria impairment aside from the toxicity of the treatment and therefore it may enhance the susceptibility for the clinical onset of ART side-effects.', 'HIV-1 Tat is a 101-residue protein codified by two exons that promotes the efficient elongation of the viral transcripts through the binding to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex and the recruitment of cellular elongation factors [12]. The first exon of Tat includes amino acids (aa) 1–72 and encodes an active protein that partially retains the elongation ability of full-length Tat [13]. The second exon is codified by amino acids 73–101 and its expression within the protein results in a more competent transcriptional protein with additional functions independent of transcription such as control of apoptosis [14, 15]. Tat can be released from infected cells and up-taken by non-infected adjacent cells. Extracellular and intracellular Tat frequently have opposite actions, as Tat expressed inside the host-infected cells can delay apoptosis upon FasL-challenge [14–17], but it is a potent death inductor in its soluble form [18, 19]. Although loss of ∆ψm and increased levels of ROS has been found after Tat extracellular exposure [20–22], few data are available about the effect of intracellular Tat on mitochondria functions. Our group showed that intracellular Tat deregulated the expression of proteins required for mitochondrial membrane stabilization as HSP and Prohibitin [15].', 'In this work, we describe the single influence of intracellular HIV-1 Tat protein on mitochondria overall functions in CD4+ T cells, showing that Tat101 remodeled mitochondria distribution and enhanced the mitochondria content probably to compensate the mtDNA transcription impairment. These effects were enhanced when Tat second exon was expressed.', 'To describe the role of Tat on mitochondria, Jurkat cells stably expressing Tat72 (Jurkat-Tat72) or Tat101 (Jurkat-Tat101) protein were used as a proper model of CD4+ T lymphocytes as previously shown [15]. The proteome of Jurkat-Tat101 and Jurkat-Tat72 was analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)/MS in basal conditions, in comparison with control cells. A comparative analysis of the LC–MS/MS proteome showed that the intracellular expression of Tat101 deregulated the expression of 19 cellular proteins involved in metabolism and control of oxidative stress (Table\xa01). A total of 14 proteins were up-regulated, representing 73.68\xa0% of the deregulated proteins. To a lower extend, these proteins were also deregulated in Jurkat-Tat72 cells. Proteins with major functions in glycolysis included alpha-enolase (ENO1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDHB) and pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (PKM2), which were, respectively 17.9-, −11.4-, 10.4- and 36.8-fold expressed in Jurkat-Tat101 cells versus control cells. It was found an overall up-regulation of proteins from the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin redox superfamilies. These proteins included protein disulfide-isomerase (P4HB), thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17 (TXDC17), protein disulfide-isomerase A4 (PDIA4) and SH3 domain-binding glutamic acid-rich-like protein 3 (SH3BGR3), which were, respectively, 2.5-, 2.8-, 5.2-, and 8.4-fold deregulated. Other proteins related to the oxidative metabolism such as superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and peroxiredoxin-1 (PRDX1) were 3.3- and 7.8-fold up-regulated in Jurkat-Tat101 cells. Most of these proteins were functionally interconnected as it was observed after analyzing the predicted interactions by STRING database (Fig.\xa01).Table\xa01Selection of mitochondrial-related proteins which showed at least a ±2.0-fold deregulation in Jurkat-Tat101 versus control cellsGeneProteinTat72 vs TetOffTat101 vs TetOffBiological processPeptide sequenceX-corrPKM2Pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M26.536.8GlycolysisAPIIAVTRNPQTAREAEAAIYHLQLFEELRRFGVEQDVDMVFASFIRGSGTAEVELKKIYVDDGLISLQVKKGVNLPGAAVDLPAVSEKDIQDLKLDIDSPPITARRFDEILEASDGIMVARSVETLKEMIKTATESFASDPILYRPVAVALDTKTATESFASDPILYRPVAVALDTKGPEIR2.651.812.902.061.883.722.013.161.962.803.18LDHB\nl-lactate dehydrogenase (B chain)−0.910.4GlycolysisIVADKDYSVTANSKLKDDEVAQLKKSADTLWDIQKSADTLWDIQKDLKDL2.072.262.052.08SH3BGRL3SH3 domain-binding glutamic acid-rich-like protein 39.98.1Oxidative stressIQYQLVDISQDNALRDEMRVYSTSVTGSR3.122.48PRDX1Peroxiredoxin-17.97.8Oxidative stressQGGLGPMNIPLVSDPKRQITVNDLPVGRTIAQDYGVLKADEGISFR1.782.062.95PDIA4Protein disulfide-isomerase A40.75.2Oxidative stressFDVSGYPTIKFDVSGYPTLKIDATSASVLASRMDATANDVPSDRVDATAETDLAKR1.981.982.511.751.83TKTTransketolase−1.24.9Energy metabolismILATPPQEDAPSVDIANIRKAYGQALAKMFGIDRDAIAQAVR1.802.292.71TXNDC17Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 170.92.8Oxidative stressYEEVSVSGFEEFHR1.77SOD1Superoxide dismutase0.43.3Oxidative stressTLVVHEKADDLGKTLVVHEKADDLGKGGNEESTK1.763.07ALDOAFructose-bisphoshate aldolase A8.92.7GlycolysisAAQEEYVKRGILAADESTGSIAKGILAADESTGSIAKRIGEHTPSALAIMENANVLARIVAPGKGILAADESTGSIAKIVAPGKGILAADESTGSIAKRLQSIGTENTEENR1.883.032.612.693.803.912.41P4HBProtein disulfide-isomerase1.52.5Oxidative stressMDSTANEVEAVKVHSFPTLK2.02GYS1Glycogen synthase, muscle0.92.5GlycogenesisLSDLLDWKTQVELLEAPTPALKRVGGIYTVLQTK1.791.941.87TPM4Tropomyosin alpha-49.92.2Oxidative stressKIQALQQQADEAEDR2.13TALDO1Transaldolase0.62.2Energy metabolismWLHNEDQMAVEK2.15PEBP1Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein0.02.2Oxidative stressLYEQLSGKWSGPLSLQEVDEQPQHPLHVTYAGAA1.792.68PARK7Protein DJ-11.8−2.0AutophagyFusionMorphogenesisGAEEMETVIPVDVMRGAEEMETVIPVDVMRR2.082.00PGK1Phosphoglycerate kinase 11.3−2.7GlycolysisAHSSMVGVNLPQKLGDVYVNDAFGTAHRVDFNVPMKNNQITNNQRVLPGVDALSNI1.812.602.001.96TPI1Triosephosphate isomerase isoform 1−5.3−3.0Glycolysis gluconeogenesisSNVSDAVAQSTRVVLAYEPVWAIGTGK2.952.65GAPDHGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase−10.8−11.4GlycolysisGALQNIIPASTGAAKIKWGDAGAEYVVESTGVFTTMEKLISWYDNEFGYSNRVGVNGFGRVVDLMAHMASKEWGDAGAEYVVESTGVFTTMEK1.812.173.072.092.872.53PDIA3Protein disulfide-isomerase A3−15.0−11.9Oxidative stressDGEEAGAYDGPREATNPPVIQEEKPKELSDFISYLQRGFPTIYFSPANKIFRDGEEAGAYDGPRKYEGGRELSDFISYLQRLSKDPNIVIAKMDATANDVPSPYEVRQAGPASVPLRQAGPASVPLRTEEEFKKRLAPEYEAAATRTADGIVSHLKKYGVSGYPTLK2.092.302.432.343.092.912.142.622.591.822.682.682.05Proteins were detected by mass spectrometry in total protein extracts.

Therefore, the expression of cytoskeleton-related proteins was analyzed by LC–MS/MS and predicted protein interactions were analyzed by STRING database (Fig.\xa07a). Jurkat-Tat101 cells, and to a lesser extent Jurkat-Tat72 cells, showed the deregulation of 20 cytoskeleton-related proteins (Table\xa03). Only five deregulated proteins were tubulin-related. Fifteen actin-related proteins were altered in Jurkat-Tat101 cells. Three of these proteins were involved in small-GTPase signal transduction, including Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (ARHGDIB) and GDP dissociation inhibitor beta protein (GDI2), which were −10.0- and +2.0-fold deregulated. Furthermore, the activation of RhoA and Rac1 GTPase increased 22.38- and 4.67-fold in Jurkat-Tat101 (p\xa0<\xa00.005) but not in Jurkat-Tat72 cells (Fig.\xa07b), in comparison to control cells. Non-significant differences were found in the activation of Cdc42 (Fig.\xa07c). Finally, cells were stained with an antibody against tubulin to elucidate the cellular shape. Most Jurkat-Tat101 cells showed polarized shape, whereas non-polarized and typically round-shape lymphocytes were observed in Jurkat-Tat72 and control cells (Fig.\xa07d).

The mitochondria network of Jurkat-Tat101 and control cells was analyzed after incubating with Mitotracker and DAPI. Two different phenotypes, which included a homogeneous and a polarized distribution of the mitochondria network, were identified (Fig.\xa08a). The overall presence of the polarized phenotype increased up to 50\xa0% in Jurkat-Tat101 cells whereas in control cells reached 9.5\xa0%. These phenotypes corresponding to homogeneous and polarized distribution of the mitochondria network were also identified in Jurkat-Tat101 cells by electron microscopy (Fig.\xa08b).

Jurkat-Tat101 and Jurkat-Tat72 cells were transfected with pAcGFP1-Mito vector that encodes a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused with a precursor of the cytochrome c oxidase VIII subunit in order to quantify the average amount of mitochondria. As mitochondrial pre-proteins are rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm by proteasomes when they are not properly imported into the mitochondria, GFP from pAcGFP1-Mito vector only occurs when the protein targets the mitochondria [41]. G-mean of green fluorescence intensity of the living cell population increased 5.17-fold in Jurkat-Tat101 cells but only 2.35-fold in Jurkat-Tat72 cells, as compared to control cells (p\xa0<\xa00.005) (Fig.\xa08c). The levels of two mtDNA-segments that match with the area of COX-II and MTND-2 genes were measured by qPCR. The amount of mtDNA COX-II and MTND-2 regions increased 1.7-fold in Jurkat-Tat101 cells (p\xa0<\xa00.005), while it only occurred in COX-II mtDNA fragment in Jurkat-Tat72 cells (p\xa0<\xa00.05) (Fig.\xa08d).

In PBLs transiently expressing Tat101, intracellular and extracellular lactate levels increased 1.54- and 1.60-fold (p\xa0<\xa00.05), respectively (Fig.\xa09c, d). Relative instead of absolute experimental data are shown because both intracellular and extracellular lactate concentrations varied among independent donors, but the same tendency was observed in each experiment. These results support our previous findings in Jurkat-Tat101 cells shown in Fig.\xa02.', 'The importance of Tat in modifying mitochondrial main functions was evaluated in the context of viral replication. Jurkat cells were infected by electroporation with the Tat-defective viral genome pNL4.3-TatM1I [15] along with pTat101 or pcDNA3 as control vector. pEGFP vector was co-transfected to measure the transfection efficiency, which was 21 and 25\xa0% in control cells and in HIV-infected cells, respectively (Fig.\xa010a, upper panel). HIV-1 replication was assessed by quantifying p24/Gag levels in the culture supernatants (Fig.\xa010a, lower panel). The levels of p24/Gag increased 652.9-fold in transfected with NL4.3-TatM1I and expressing Tat101 versus control cells infected only with defective NL4.3-TatM1I. Control cells expressed similar levels of p24/Gag than cells transfected with pcDNA3 alone (data not shown). As HIV-1 replication occurred from vector expression, expression levels of Tat in pNL4.3-TatM1I transfected Jurkat cells were compared to Tat levels in Jurkat cells infected with HIV-1. Immunoblotting analysis showed that Tat expression levels were 2.0-fold increased in Jurkat cells transfected with pNL4.3-TatM1I along with pCMV-Tat101 vectors in comparison to Tat levels in Jurkat cells infected with NL4.3 virions (Additional file 1: Fig.\xa0S1a). Accordingly, HIV-1 replication, measured by quantifying p24/Gag levels in the culture supernatant, was also 3.3-fold enhanced in transfected versus infected cells (Additional file 1: Fig.\xa0S1b). These data suggest that Tat expression from transfection or infection may be equivalent in Jurkat cells. Neither Tat expression nor HIV-1 replication were found in non-infected Jurkat cells or in Jurkat cells transfected with pNL4.3-TatM1I along with pcDNA3 (Additional file 1: Fig.\xa0S1a, b).Fig.\xa010Intracellular ATP levels, GSH/GSSG ratio, caspase-3/7 activation, mtDNA transcription and mitochondrial content in HIV-1 infected T lymphocytes.

These data suggest that intracellular Tat101 is responsible for reduced ATP levels, caspase-3/7 activation and enhanced mitochondrial content during HIV-1 infection in T lymphocytes.', 'Mitochondrial OXPHOS is altered in PBMCs from naïve patients [6, 7], demonstrating that HIV-1 replication per se results in mitochondrial damage independent of ART. In this work, we show that intracellular expression of Tat101 partly leads this process.', 'The expression of nuclear encoded genes involved in mitochondrial functions was upregulated in Jurkat-Tat101 cells but the transcription of mtDNA genes was dramatically resulting in the impairment of mitochondria functions. This lack of coordination between mtDNA and nuclear genes expression may also result in a defective OXPHOS [42]. Accordingly, complex-I and complex-V were inhibited in Jurkat-Tat101 cells. During HIV-1 infection, the inhibition of complex-I activity reduces the levels of ATP, although ATP synthesis does not stop completely [8]. Furthermore, the reduction of ATP activates a phosphofructokinase that finally increases the concentration of intracellular lactate [43]. Indeed, ATP levels were reduced and subsequently intracellular lactate was accumulated in the cytoplasm of PBLs transiently expressing Tat, CD4+ T cells expressing Tat101 and HIV-1 infected T cells. The modest effect of Tat observed in PBLs was probably due to lower transfection efficiency. It results in the dilution of Tat-mediated effects in the whole population of PBLs, as most of them were not expressing Tat intracellularly.', 'Lactate can trigger the degradation of IκBα, resulting in the autocrine activation of the transcription factor NF-κB [44], which is essential for HIV-1 replication and gets activated upon intracellular Tat expression [14, 15, 45]. Intracellular lactate levels are secondly regulated by the use of the specific monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) that allows the diffusion of the lactate out of the cells [46]. Extracellular amounts of lactate did not significantly change in Jurkat-Tat cells, suggesting that high amounts of lactate can be supported without resulting in toxicity. However, enhanced lactate release was found in PBLs from healthy donors expressing Tat protein and in HIV-1 infected cells, reducing the possibility that Tat modifies the MCT1 during HIV-1 infection. Elevated lactate in blood is a noticeable toxic effect of ART and is used to define mitochondrial toxicity in treated HIV-1 patients [47].', 'Compensatory mechanisms for mitochondria toxicity, including mtDNA increase, have been shown in different subsets of human cells subjected to ART [47–49]. However, PBMCs from naïve patients show mtDNA depletion [6]. Here, we demonstrated that Tat101 increased the mitochondria content in T lymphocytes but not enough to compensate mitochondria impairment. Other discrepancies regarding mtDNA content have been described in adipose tissues from non-treated HIV-1 patients [50, 51], suggesting that the effect of HIV-1 on mitochondria may depend on connected factors that remain to be fully elucidated. Here, an increase of mitochondria content was described in HIV-1 infected cells, contrary to Jurkat-Tat101 cells. This finding suggests that during HIV-1 replication other viral proteins compensate Tat-mediated mitochondrial impairment, although not completely as ATP synthesis was also compromised in HIV-1 infected T cells.', 'In Jurkat-Tat101 cells, a compensatory mechanism may be changing the cellular preferred metabolism into aerobic glycolysis through a generalized up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes. Indeed, HIV-1 infected cells show a metabolic reprogramming that reduces the energy production from the tricarboxylic acid cycle to aerobic glycolysis [52, 53]. The aerobic glycolysis is a metabolic program, occurring usually in activated lymphocytes [25, 54], in which the lactate is produced in the presence of oxygen, to differentiate it from the anaerobic fermentation of glucose to lactate that arose from faults in respiration [24]. As it was discussed above, lactate production was enhanced in Jurkat-Tat101 cells, PBLs expressing Tat101 and HIV-1 infected cells. Furthermore, our data suggest that the main breakdown point may include the synthesis of pyruvate and the intermediate metabolite glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), probably through a dramatic repression of GAPDH. Additionally, intracellular Tat101 enhanced the expression of PKM2 and LDHB, which together increase the conversion of lactate from pyruvate in the cytoplasm. PKM2 is crucial for metabolism shift during HIV-1 pathogenesis, as up-regulation of PKM2 has been observed in different types of HIV-1 infected cells [52, 55, 56]. In contrast to OXPHOS, glycolysis is energetically inefficient, theoretically yielding two molecules of ATP per glucose molecule consumed compared to thirty-six if it is fully oxidized. However, aerobic glycolysis has the energetic advantage of generating ATP at higher speed than OXPHOS [57]. Therefore, activated lymphocytes do not activate aerobic glycolysis only because their capacity for OXPHOS is saturated but also to provide sufficient ATP to support the cellular growth and proliferation [58–60]. In summary, aerobic glycolysis may be activated in Jurkat-Tat101 cells as a complementary source of ATP production.', 'Increased production of ROS due to diminished complex I activity and subsequent reduction in ATP levels has been extensively described in infected CD4+ T cells [8]. Indeed, extracellular Tat is known to increased generation of ROS and caspase-3/7 activation in the intestinal mucosa of HIV-infected patients [20]. In this work, it is shown that intracellular Tat101 increased ROS production and apoptosis induction, and both processes were coupled. However the GSH/GSSG ratio was balanced in Jurkat-Tat101 cells despite of the chronic oxidative stress detected in HIV-1 infected lymphocytes. Therefore, our data cannot point out a role of intracellular Tat expression in the overall glutathione imbalanced showed in PBLs from HIV-1 infected patients. Because of the experimental systems used in this work, we cannot rule out the role of other viral proteins in the induction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in infected T cells. In particular, extracellular Tat and other viral proteins as extracellular Vpr are able to reduce GSH/GSSG ratio [20, 61], and may gain value during HIV-1 infection in vivo. Although chronic oxidative stress is detected in HIV patients [62, 63], most in vivo studies are focused on patients under ART, where viral load is not detectable [64–67] and treatment enhances the synergy of HIV and oxidative stress [68]. This fact together with the low number of productively infected lymphocytes in peripheral blood HIV-1 in vivo infection [69, 70] suggest that not only HIV-1 replication itself but additional factors may contribute to oxidative stress as part of HIV-1 disease pathogenesis. This phenomenon may be related to the chronic immune activation and senescence produced by increased microbial translocation and persistent viremia or secondary to the increased rate of opportunistic infections as it has been described [71–73].', 'ROS levels are responsible for the profound reorganization of mitochondria-cytoskeletal interactions found in HIV-1 patients [7]. Furthermore, ROS lead to the appearance of dense stress fibers, required for intercellular contacts and migration [74]. In line with it, the mitochondria network of Jurkat-Tat101 cells was localized at one edge of the lymphocyte, reflecting the acquisition of a polarized shaped and probably as a host defense response to supply enough energy to the migration process. Because mitochondria are transported to the uropod along microtubules [38], it seems that microtubule dynamics are persevered in Jurkat-Tat cells for mitochondria trafficking and delocalization at the uropod. Furthermore, profound actin cytoskeleton changes may also be responsible for Tat-mediated mitochondria delocalization. For instance, intracellular Tat101 activated RhoA and Rac1, actin remodeling GTPases that control mitochondria trafficking [75], probably through the depletion of ARHGDIB, a protein that promotes the misfolding and degradation of the cytosolic pool of Rho GTPases together with the activation of the remaining membrane bound pool [76, 77]. Accordingly, mitochondria proteome from HIV-infected patients are enriched in actin proteins [7], including the GTPase Rab1, which regulates organelle tethering through the enhancement of Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor beta protein (GDI2) [78], a modulator of Rab recycling that is up-regulated in Jurkat-Tat cells. Eventually, mitochondria accumulation also requires an unperturbed balance between fusion and fission processes [38], which might occur in Jurkat-Tat101 cells as the expression of pro-fusion MFN2 and pro-fission DNM1L genes were not deregulated.', 'It is to notice that Tat is indispensable for HIV-1 replication [13, 79, 80] and it is not packaged inside the virions [81]. Accordingly, NL4.3-TatM1I strain lacking Tat protein did not yield productive infection. Therefore only the transfection approach based on co-expressing NL4.3-TatM1I strain and Tat101 allowed a proper assessment of the impact of Tat on the different mitochondrial parameters during HIV-1 replication. Therefore, results from Jurkat expressing only intracellular Tat do not always correlate with data from infection, where other viral proteins exert compensatory mechanisms to success viral replication.', 'This work shows the influence of intracellular HIV-1 Tat protein on mitochondrial overall functions in Jurkat cells and PBLs. Tat101 polarized the mitochondria distribution and increased the mitochondrial content, probably to compensate mtDNA transcription impairment and low ATP production. Tat101 also enhanced the expression of metabolism-related proteins and mitochondrial-related genes. The presence of Tat second exon increased these effects, confirming that full-length Tat mostly regulated the non-transcriptional functions of the protein. The intracellular expression of Tat may be responsible for the mitochondrial dysfunctions found in HIV-1 infected patients as for instance OXPHOS impairment and increased mtDNA content and therefore Tat may enhance the susceptibility to mitochondrial toxicity during ART.', 'Jurkat TetOff cell line was purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech (Mountain View, CA, USA). The high-level gene expression TetOff system [82], which keeps the expression of the gene cloned in pTRE2hyg vector continually turned on. Unlike other inducible mammalian expression systems, gene regulation in the Tet systems is highly specific, so the interpretation of results would not be hindered by pleiotropic effects or nonspecific induction (Yin et al. 1996). The vector pTRE2hyg-Tat101 expressed a complete HIV-1 tat gene (aa 1–101), obtained from pCMV-Tat101 vector [83], after cloning in pTRE2hyg vector (Clontech, BD Tet-Off gene expression System, BD Biosciences). Complementary DNA (cDNA) from tat first exon (1–219nt; 1–72aa) was obtained from pCMV-Tat101 vector using specific oligonucleotides to introduce a stop codon at residue 73, and then cloned in pTRE2hyg vector. Jurkat TetOff was transfected by electroporation with pTRE2hyg-Tat72 or pTRE2hyg-Tat101 vectors and these cell lines were stabilized with hygromycin B as previously described [14, 16]. The empty pTRE2hyg vector was transfected and stabilized in the Jurkat TetOff cell line into obtained negative control cells. Jurkat-Tat101 and Jurkat-Tat72 cells are not clone populations but a mixed population in which more than 75\xa0% of the cells express high intracellular amounts of Tat101 (full-length) or Tat72 (first exon) protein which were equivalent to Tat levels detected in T lymphocytes infected with the HIV-1 infectious clone NL4.3wt [16].
