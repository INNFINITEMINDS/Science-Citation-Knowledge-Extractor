['\n        We report the chloroplast (cp) genome sequence of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) obtained by next-generation sequencing technology and compared this with the previously reported common buckwheat (F. esculentum ssp. ancestrale) cp genome. The cp genome of F. tataricum has a total sequence length of 159,272 bp, which is 327 bp shorter than the common buckwheat cp genome. The cp gene content, order, and orientation are similar to those of common buckwheat, but with some structural variation at tandem and palindromic repeat frequencies and junction areas. A total of seven InDels (around 100 bp) were found within the intergenic sequences and the ycf1 gene. Copy number variation of the 21-bp tandem repeat varied in F. tataricum (four repeats) and F. esculentum (one repeat), and the InDel of the ycf1 gene was 63 bp long. Nucleotide and amino acid have highly conserved coding sequence with about 98% homology and four genes—rpoC2, ycf3, accD, and clpP—have high synonymous (Ks) value. PCR based InDel markers were applied to diverse genetic resources of F. tataricum and F. esculentum, and the amplicon size was identical to that expected in silico.

The chloroplast (cp) is considered to have originated from an ancestral endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. In addition to the larger dominant genome located in the nucleus of plant cell, chloroplasts contain their own independent genome encoding a specific set of proteins. The non-recombinant nature of the cp genome makes it a potentially useful tool in genomics and evolutionary studies. Although the cp genome is highly conserved in vascular plants, evolutionary hotspots such as single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] and insertion/deletions [In/Dels] resulting from inversions, translocations, rearrangements and copy number variation of tandem repeats have been found in many plants [1]. As such, these SNPs and In/Dels are useful as molecular markers as the cp genome is highly conserved within the species. Further, cp DNA can be easily extracted from samples because of the high copy number. The small size of the cp genome makes it suitable for complete sequencing and the data can be further applied to phylogeny construction [2], DNA bar coding [3], and transplastomic studies [4]. Complete cp DNA sequencing began in 1991 [5] and to date cp genomes of various algae and plants, including crop species, have been reported (CpBase: http://chloroplasr.ocean.washington.edu).', 'Until recently, cp genome sequencing was a costly and time-consuming process. The majority of such research, therefore, has been limited to sequencing a small portion of the cp genome, which in many cases is insufficient for determining evolutionary relationships, thereby limiting its utility for plant evolutionary and genomic studies. As complete cp genome sequences harbor sufficient information, sequencing of whole cp genomes is essential for the comparison and analyses of diversifications among plant species. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has made it considerably cheaper and easier to sequence complete cp genomes. NGS is advantageous as it provides extremely high yield and the opportunity for multiplexing when investigating whole-cp genomes, rather than targeting individual regions [6,7]. NGS allows potentially hundreds of flowering plant cp genomes to be sequenced simultaneously, significantly reducing the per-sample cost of cp genome sequencing [8].', 'Buckwheat (Fagopyrum species) belonging to Polygonaceae, a member of knotgrass is an annual herbaceous plant. Buckwheat is classified into twenty species, is largely centered in the Eurasian region, and is mainly grown in the highlands [9,10]. It is divided into two groups—cymosum and urophyllum, based on the morphology and cp genome [11]. The cymosum group comprises F. esculentum, F. tataricum, F. cymosum, and F. homotropicum, which are characterized according to the flowering calyx (persistent perianth) and achene. The urophyllum group comprises F. urophyllum, which is characterized by a glossy calyx. Among these, common buckwheat (F. esculentum) and tartary buckwheat (also known as bitter buckwheat (F. tataricum), are used in various dietary preparations and are mainly grown in South Korea, Japan, and China [12]. Because of the nutritional value of tartary buckwheat, the cultivated area in South Korea has increased in recent years [13]. Bitter buckwheat is a particularly rich source of rutin compared to common buckwheat, which helps reduce intra-vascular cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Rutin is also reported to have a crucial role in pharmaceutical research [14,15,16].', 'The complete cp genome of Fagopyrum may provide useful information for phylogenetic comparisons with the related species. To date there have been few cp genome sequencing studies performed in buckwheat.

The rps19 gene of the LSC in F. tataricum extended into the IRb region, which created a short pseudo gene of 108 bp at the LSC/IRb junction. This rps19 pseudo gene is 104 bp in F. esculentum.

More divergence was found in the sequences of the trnL-UAA, ndhF, trnM-CAU ndhK, petN, rpoB, trnS-GCU, and trnR-UCU regions, compared to others.

Of these, 15 were found within intergenic sequences (IGS) and four within coding sequences, all of which shared a similar sequence identity between the two species. These repeating units are repeated from one to four times in both species. Among these repeats, eleven repeats are located in the LSC, seven within in the IR and one in the SSC region (Table 2). Those tandem repeats located in the IR region are highly diverged and the copy number variation of the tandem repeats within the TR15 (Tandem repeat 15 shown in Table 2) in the ycf1 gene could account for the 63 bp InDel #7 (Fig 5). Similarly, palindromic repeats were also compared between the two species; identifying three and four repeats in F. tataricum and F. esculentum respectively. Among the palindormic repeats, four are located in the IGS and one is located in rpl16 intron region of the LSC region. Among these, both species have palindromic repeats at two similar locations, namely the IGS of rbcL and accD and the IGS of psbT and psbN.

The presence of these six InDels in the IGS region was confirmed by PCR amplification in both F. tataricum and F. esculentum. PCR analysis of InDel #2 showed a variation in the size of the amplicon in F. esculentum. InDel #3 to InDel #6 showed identical amplicon sizes and sequences to those of the complete cp sequences (Fig 6). We utilized the PCR markers for the InDel regions #3 to #6 to evaluate the genotypes among large collections of both species: 11 F. tataricum and 11 F. esculentum accessions.

Solid line indicates F. tataricum, dotted line indicates F. esculentum.', 'Chloroplast DNA sequences are widely used in genetic engineering [24] and in reconstructing evolutionary relationships among plants [11, 25, 26]. Complete cp genome sequences harbor enough information to reconstruct both recent and ancient diversifications. Although some cp genome sequences are available from more than 500 species, the complete cp genome sequence for many important plant species is not available yet [27, 28]. This is due to complete sequencing having been a costly and time-intensive effort, thus limiting sequencing to a small portion of the cp genome, which in many cases is insufficient for determining evolutionary relationships, especially within species or between closely related species. In recent years, new DNA sequencing technologies, termed next-generation sequencers, have made it considerably cheaper and easier to sequence complete cp genomes. While current methods using next-generation sequencers allow up to 48 cp genomes to be sequenced at one time, newer methods will allow potentially hundreds of flowering plant cp genomes to be sequenced at once, significantly reducing the per-sample cost of cp genome sequencing [8]. The powerful and flexible nature of NGS has permeated many areas of study, enabling the development of a broad range of applications that have transformed study designs capable of unlocking information of the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome of any organism. Here, we have obtained the complete and error-free cp genome sequence using low coverage whole genome sequences for F. tataricum and applied this to a comparative analysis with the cp sequence of the closely related F. esculentum species.', 'Variation in the divergence of the coding region was observed between tartary and common buckwheat species. Although the coding region exhibited a highly conserved nature, rpoC2, ycf3, accD, and clpP genes of the LSC region of tartary buckwheat showed a higher evolution rate compared to other genes. Yamane et al. [26] found that the accD gene had a high evolution rate in Fagopyrum and proposed that this gene was under a weak selection constraint. This is consistent with the high Ks value (2.4538) obtained for accD in this study (S4 Table). Other genes we identified as having an unexpectedly high evolution rate between the two studied Fagopyrum species include rpoC2, ycf3, and clpP. Cuenoud et al. [25] reported that the matK gene has a higher Ks value than accD, but in this study, we found the value of matK gene is lower than that of accD gene in our investigated samples. Distribution of Ks values indicate that the LSC region is under greater selection pressure than the rest of the cp genome and our data confirm a positive selection pressure and neutral evolution of the protein coding genes. The ratio of non-synonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) value, Ka/Ks ratio, showed a similar pattern to Ks values for most of genes except several genes such as ycf1 and ycf2 genes. The accD, clpP, ycf3 genes in LSC and ycf1, ycf2 in IR region presented a higher Ka/Ks ratio value (>1.0). The ycf1 and ycf2 genes with unclear functions in IR region showed a biased high value for Ka/Ks ratio value compared to Ks value that indicate these two genes evolved at a faster rate in addition to other three genes of LSC. Based on the sequence similarity among the three regions, the IR region is more conserved than the LSC and SSC regions. This is in agreement with earlier reports that hypothesized that the frequent recombinant events occurring in the IR region result in selective constraints on sequence homogeneity, resulting in the IR region diverging at a slower rate than single copy regions [29, 30, 31].', 'The evolutionary InDel hot spots were compared between F. tataricum and F. esculentum. Six InDels within IGS regions are identical among accessions of each species and showed clear polymorphism between the F. tataricum and F. esculentum species. Meanwhile, there was variation among accessions of F. esculentum for InDel #2, indicating there is sequence divergence among the wild germplasm of F. esculentum, even if there is no variation among the domesticated accessions of F. tataricum. The F. tataricum reference sequence is that of the wild ancestor of common buckwheat, F. esculentum Moench subsp. ancestrale [17, 32] and analyses implied that in cultivated common buckwheat an InDel region contributed to sequence variation during domestication and resulting in amplicon size variation. PCR analysis of the InDel #3 region in 75 F. tataricum and 21 F. esculentum germplasm lines confirmed the presence of the InDel #3 region, which always showed a similar amplicon size (data not shown). All of the tested accessions have different geographical origins and show diversity [33]. This suggests that, although these accessions are from different locations, which differ in the nuclear genome, they share similar cp genomes. This application of PCR analysis to the InDel region can be effectively used as a biomarker to identify varietal contamination in seeds mixtures [34]. Markers, such as DNA polymorphism or specific protein electrophoretic bands, may be analyzed directly using tissues from individual plants or the endosperm of the seed [35]. PCR amplification of the InDel region shown in this study can be efficiently utilized in the identification procedure of buckwheat seed mixture containing two species (i.e., F. tataricum and F. esculentum). It can also be applied for authentication of the raw materials used for high value processed foods, such as buckwheat tea and buckwheat noodles that contain various proportions of the two buckwheat species. Yoon et al., [36] used starch granule associated proteins (SGAPs) as a biomarker to identify the botanical origin of starches used in noodle manufacture. Dietary material prepared from F. tataricum is more beneficial than those prepared from F. esculentum because tartary buckwheat is a richer source of rutin compared to common buckwheat, which helps in reducing intra-vascular cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and is also reported to have a crucial role in pharmaceutical research [13]. Hence, PCR analysis of the InDel region described here can be utilized as a biomarker to differentiate between F. tataricum and F. esculentum in raw materials or processed buckwheat products.', 'We present the first report of the complete cp genome sequence of F. tataricum and describe the evolutional relationship between the two cultivated buckwheat species.
