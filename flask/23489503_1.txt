The plant is originally from Southeast\nAsia (Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines) and the islands between the Indian and\nPacific Oceans. From that region, the fruit of the coconut palm is believed to have been\nbrought to India and then to East Africa. After the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope,\nthis plant was introduced into West Africa and, from there, dispersed to the American\ncontinent and to other tropical regions of the globe (2).', 'The plant is an arborescent monocotyledonous tree of around 25 m in height (giant\ncoconut) with a dense canopy (Figure 1). The root\nof the coconut system is fasciculated. The stem is an unbranched type, and at its apex,\na tuft of leaves protects a single apical bud. The pinnate leaves are feather-shaped,\nhaving a petiole, rachis and leaflets. Under favorable environmental conditions, the\ngiant adult coconut emits 12–14 inflorescence spikes per year, while the adult dwarf\ncoconut can emit 18 spikes in the same period. The axillary inflorescence has globular\nclusters of female flowers. The plant is monoecious (male and female reproductive organs\non the same plant) (3).', 'The coconut fruit comprises an outer epicarp, a mesocarp, and an inner endocarp. The\nepicarp, which is the outer skin of the fruit, and the mesocarp, which is heavy,\nfibrous, and tanned when dry, have many industrial uses. The endocarp is the hard dark\ncore. Inside is a solid white albumen of varied thickness, depending on the age of the\nfruit, and with an oily pulp consistency and a liquid albumen called coconut water that\nis thick, sweet, and slightly acidic (3,4). The authors and the synonyms of the plant were\nconfirmed using www.theplantlist.org (Table\n1).', '\n\n', 'The present review highlights the traditional uses of C. nucifera,\nphytochemical compounds isolated from different parts of the plant, and the biological\nactivity and toxicological studies to date.', 'Articles published in English were searched in the online databases Scopus, Science\nDirect, PubMed, SciVerse and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), with no time\nlimits. Search terms included combinations of the following: ‘Cocos\nnucifera’, ‘C. nucifera and phytochemical profile’,\n‘C. nucifera and pharmacological properties’, and ‘C.\nnucifera and toxicology’.', 'All parts of the fruit of the coconut tree can be used. Both the green coconut water\nand solid albumen ripe fruits are used industrially and in home cooking in many ways\n(5). Additionally, several parts of the\nfruit and plant have been used by people in different countries for the treatment of\nvarious pathological conditions (Table\n2).', '\n\n', 'Currently, appreciation of natural coconut water is growing. Industry is using the\nhusk fiber from the pith as raw material for carpets, car seat stuffing, and in\nagricultural as fertilizers. The hard core is used to make handcrafts. The stalk and\nleaves of the coconut tree are useful in construction, and sugar, vinegar, and\nalcohol can be extracted from the inflorescence (6).', 'In Brazil, extract from the husk fiber of C. nucifera is used to\ntreat diarrhea (7). In Papua New Guinea, the\nleaves and roots of young plants are chewed as treatment for diarrhea and\nstomachaches (8,9). In Fiji, coconut oil is used to prevent hair loss and coconut\nwater is used to treat renal disease (10). In\nGhana, people use coconut milk to treat diarrhea (11). In Guatemala, the husk fiber extract is used as an antipyretic, to\nreduce renal inflammation, and as a topic ointment for dermatitis, abscesses, and\ninjuries (12). In Haiti, a decoction of the\ndry pericarp is used for oral treatment of amenorrhea, and the oil is applied as an\nointment to burns (13); an aqueous extract\nfrom the husk fiber is also used for oral asthma treatment (14). In India, infusions made with the coconut inflorescence are\nused for the oral treatment of menstrual cycle disorders (15). In Indonesia, the oil is used as a wound ointment, the\ncoconut milk is used as an oral contraceptive, and fever and diarrhea are treated\nwith the root extract (16–18). In Jamaica, the husk fiber extract is used\nto treat diabetes (19,20). In Mozambique, the fruit is consumed by men as an\naphrodisiac (21). Peruvians use the aqueous\nextract of the fresh coconut fiber orally for asthma, as a diuretic, and for\ngonorrhea (22). In Trinidad, bark extract is\nused orally for amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea, and bark tea is used to treat venereal\ndiseases (23). In Mexico, coconut is used to\ntreat various disorders associated with urogenital tract infection by\nTrichomonas vaginalis (24). A decoction of the white flesh of the fruit is used in rural Malaysia to\ntreat fever and malaria (25). In Kenya, the\nfruit is used to relieve skin rash caused by HIV infection (26).', 'Phytochemical studies of the coconut fiber (mesocarp) ethanolic extract revealed that\nthe presence of phenols, tannins, leucoanthocyanidins, flavonoids, triterpenes,\nsteroids, and alkaloids (27), while a butanol\nextract recovered triterpenes, saponins, and condensed tannins (28). Notably, compounds like flavonoids having antioxidant action\nare widely distributed in edible vegetables, fruits, and many herbs (29–31).\nCondensed tannins are reported to possess antihelminthic activity by binding to\nproteins present in the cuticle, oral cavity, esophagus, and cloaca of nematodes,\nthus intensifying the physical and chemical damage in helminth (32).', 'The lyophilized extract and fractions, as well as ethyl acetate extracts, from the\nC. nucifera fiber are rich in polyphenols, compounds such as\ncatechins, epicatechins, tannins, and flavonoids (7,33–35).', 'The constituents of the liquid albumen were identified as vitamin B, nicotinic acid\n(B3, 0.64 µg/mL), pantothenic acid (B5, 0.52 µg/mL), biotin (0.02 µg/mL), riboflavin\n(B2, <0.01 ng/mL), folic acid (0.003 µg/mL), with trace quantities of vitamins B1,\nB6, and C, pyridoxine, thiamine, folic acid, amino acids, L-arginine, plant hormones\n(auxin, 1,3-diphenylurea, cytokinin), enzymes (acid phosphatase, catalase,\ndehydrogenase, diastase, peroxidase, RNA polymerases), and growth-promoting factors\n(36–38). Furthermore, oil extracted from the solid albumen is primarily lauric\nacid and alpha tocopherol (39,40). Root phenolic compounds were identified as\nflavonoids and saponins (41). Other compounds\nidentified in leaf epicuticular wax were lupeol methylether, skimmiwallin,\n[3b-methoxy-25-ethyl-9,19-cyclolanost-24(241)-ene], and isoskimmiwallin\n[3b-methoxy-24-ethyl-9,19-cyclolanost-25(251)-ene] (42) (Figure 2).', 'Several studies have been conducted to identify the active molecules in coconut and\ntheir possible pharmacological and biological activities.

These effects are described below and also\nlisted in Supplementary Table S1.', 'Crude husk-fiber extract and two aqueous extract fractions of molecular weights less\nthan (F1) and greater than (F2) 1 kDa were studied for their analgesic activity by\nacetic acid-induced abdominal writhing, tail-flick, and hot plate tests in mice\n(44). All three extracts induced peripheral\nand central antinociceptive activity. Oral administration of the crude extract (50,\n100, or 150 mg/kg) significantly inhibited writhing by 24%, 34%, and 52.4%,\nrespectively, when compared with a control group. Fractions F1 and F2 reduced total\nwrithing at 10 and 50 mg/kg. In the tail-flick test, oral pre-treatment with crude\nextract (100 and 150 mg/kg), F1 (10 and 50 mg/kg), or F2 (10 and 50 mg/kg) produced\neffects better or similar to morphine (5 mg/kg) until 80 min. However, with the\nexception of F1 (50 mg/kg, 60 min after administration), neither crude extract (150\nmg/kg) nor F2 (50 mg/kg) significantly increased the latency of mice response to\nthermal stimulation in the hot-plate test. The mechanism of action of the extracts\nwere also evaluated using the opioid antagonist naloxone (5 mg/kg), which inhibited\nthe antinociceptive effect of the crude extract, F1, and F2, indicating a probable\naction on opioid receptors.', 'In another study, an ethanol extract of the husk fiber (40, 60, or 80 mg/kg) showed\nsignificant analgesic properties, as indicated by a reduction in the number of\nwrithes and stretches induced in mice by 1.2% acetic acid (41). The results were similar to those in animals that received\naspirin (68 mg/kg), paracetamol (68 mg/kg), or morphine sulfate (1.15 mg/kg).\nFurthermore, administration of the ethanol extract along with morphine or pethidine\nnot only produced analgesia in mice but also potentiated the analgesic effect of\nthese two drugs.', 'These studies were performed using coconut husk fiber extracts, suggesting that this\npart of the plant is a highly potent analgesic. Cocos nucifera may\nenable the production of new low-cost medicines for several ailments and may provide\na very inexpensive source of new analgesic drugs. Further investigations are\nwarranted.

The crude\nextract significantly (P<0.05) reduced histamine (at 150 mg/kg) and\nserotonin-induced rat paw edema (at 100 and 150 mg/kg). Even when mice were treated\nwith 1 mg/kg of F1, a significant inhibitory effect was observed in histamine and\nserotonin-induced edema. However, F2 did not inhibit the edema induced by any\npro-inflammatory agent.', 'Animal tests revealed significant activity supporting the use of these husk fiber\nextracts in traditional medicine (35). The chemical constituents responsible for\ntheir activity should be isolated, identified, and researched to establish safety\ndoses.', 'Brushing the teeth with fibrous coconut husks is a common oral hygiene practice among\nrural people of South India (46). In this\ncontext, the antimicrobial properties of alcoholic extracts of the husk against\ncommon oral pathogens were analyzed by the agar well diffusion method (47). There was significant\nconcentration-dependent antimicrobial activity, expressed as a zone of inhibition\nwith respect to all tested organisms except Actinomyces species.\nHowever, the effect of the C. nucifera extract was less than that of\nchlorhexidine.', 'Ethanolic (cold and hot percolation), dry-distilled, and aqueous extracts of coconut\nendocarp were compared with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin for their antibacterial\nactivities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n(MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Pseudomonas\naeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella\npneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter\nfreundii, Enterococcus, Streptococcus\npyrogens, Bacillus subtilis, and Micrococcus\nluteususing the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The endocarp extracts\nshowed strong antimicrobial activity against B. subtilis, P.\naeruginosa, S. aureus, and M. luteus\nbut had no effect on E. coli (26). The dry-distilled extract (1 mg/mL and 200 μg/mL) could inhibit the\ngrowth of B. subtilis and Aspergillus spp. but was\ninactive against R. oligosporus at all concentrations (48). The crude aqueous extract of husk fiber and\nfive fractions obtained by thin layer chromatography (TLC) were also tested (10, 50,\nand 100 mg/kg) against E. coli, S. aureus, and MRSA\nvia agar diffusion; they were active only against S. aureus and\nMRSA, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1024 mg/mL for both (45).', 'In another study, the antimicrobial activity of mesocarp powder extracted with six\ncommon organic solvents was evaluated by the disk diffusion method (49).

The\naqueous extracts were active against 29 of 37 Listeria isolates\nexamined, while the n-hexane extracts were active against 30 (both\nat 25 mg/mL). The diameters of the zones of inhibition were 12–17 mm and 12–24 mm,\nrespectively, while those of the control antibiotics were 20–50 mm for ampicillin and\n22–46 mm for tetracycline. The MICs of the susceptible bacteria were 0.6–2.5 mg/mL\nfor the aqueous fraction and 0.6–5.0 mg/mL for the n-hexane extract.\nThe mean reduction in viable cell count in the time kill assay with the aqueous\nextract ranged from 0.32 to 3.2 log10 CFU/mL after 4 h of interaction and\nfrom 2.6 to 4.8 log10 CFU/mL after 8 h at 1× and 2× MIC.

Some evidence points toward an antioxidant\naction of coconut water. Thus, administering coconut water (6 mL/100 g of body\nweight) to female rats intoxicated with carbon tetrachloride recovered the action of\nantioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase levels) and decreased lipid\nperoxidation (59). Coconut water is also rich\nin L-arginine (30 mg/dL), which significantly reduces the generation of free radicals\n(60) and has antioxidant activity (61), as well as ascorbic acid (15 mg/100 mL),\nwhich decreases lipid peroxidation in rats (62).', 'In summary, many parts of C. nucifera plants have proven to contain\nphenolic compounds and flavonoids that support antioxidant activity.', 'Different molecular weight fractions of husk fiber aqueous extracts of C.\nnucifera (typical A variety, commonly known as “olho-de-cravo”, and the\ncommon variety) were tested on human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and Lucena 1, a\nmultidrug-resistant (MDR) and vincristine-resistant derivative of K562. Both\nvarieties showed cytotoxicity against K562 cells and decreased by 50% the viability\nand anti-MDR activity of Lucena 1 cells. In both varieties, the antitumoral activity\nwas concentrated in fractions with molecular weights between 1 and 10 kDa (63).', 'There is great potential for future research on antineoplastic activity, as only one\nstudy has been reported.

The polyphenolic-rich extract obtained from coconut husk\nfiber completely inhibited the cellular growth of L. amazonensis\npromastigote forms (MIC 10 μg/mL) and killed 100% of both developmental stages of the\nparasite after 60 min (at 10 and 20 μg/mL). In addition, pretreatment of mouse\nperitoneal macrophages with 10 μg/mL of C. nucifera\npolyphenolic-rich extract reduced by approximately 44% their rate of association with\nL. amazonensispromastigotes with a simultaneous increase of 182%\nin nitric oxide production by macrophages compared with untreated macrophages.', 'Ethyl acetate extract (EAE) from husk fiber water was tested against L.\nbraziliensis infected hamsters (35).

Research on the\ntoxicity of these extracts is also warranted to guarantee the safety of possible\nfuture treatments.', 'Coconut water had prophylactic action against nephrolithiasis in an experiment with a\nWistar rat model (64). Rats were divided into\nthree groups. Group I (control) was fed standard rat diet. Group II was administered\n0.75% ethylene glycol in drinking water to induce nephrolithiasis. Group III was\ngiven coconut water in addition to ethylene glycol. All treatments lasted 7 weeks.\nAnalysis of urine samples revealed a drastic decrease in the number of calcium\noxalate crystals in group III compared with group II. Coconut water also\nsignificantly lowered the levels of creatinine and urea in group III animals,\nsignificantly reduced lipid peroxidation (group II: 38.99±3.36 mol MDA/mg protein/15\nmin; group III: 27.68±2.45 mol MDA/mg protein/15 min) and decreased the enzyme\nactivities of superoxide dismutase and catalase. These results demonstrate that\ncoconut water has important properties against urolithiasis and therefore must be\ninvestigated as a potential treatment for this condition.', 'Antimalarial activity of different crude methanol extracts (50, 100, 200, and 400\nmg/kg, treated orally) was investigated in vivo against\nPlasmodium berghei (NK65) in mice during early, established, and\nresidual infections. Chloroquine (20 mg/kg) and pyrimethamine (1.2 mg/kg) were used\nas reference drugs. The methanol white flesh extract of C. nucifera\nproduced a dose-dependent chemotherapeutic activity in all three in\nvivo-assessment models. In the established malaria infection, there was a\nsignificant (P<0.05) decrease after treatment with the extract (200 and 400 mg/kg)\ncompared to the reference drug for the treatment of the disease (25). These results suggest that the Malaysian\nfolkloric medicinal application of C. nucifera has a pharmacological\nbasis; however, chloroquine was much more effective at suppression and curing, and\nthe extract did not increase the survival time of infected mice, indicating the need\nfor additional studies to elucidate how C. nucifera can be used to\ntreat malaria.', 'In another study, the antimalarial and toxicity potentials of husk fiber extracts of\nfive Nigerian varieties of C. nucifera were evaluated in\nvitro. The results showed that only the West African Tall ethyl acetate\nextract fraction (WATEAEF) was active against P. falciparum W2\nstrain with a selectivity index of 30.3. The phytochemicals present in the WATEAEF\nwere alkaloids, tannins, and flavonoids. The same extract fraction was active\nin vivo against P. berghei NK65, causing more\nthan 50% reduction in parasitemia on days 4 and 6 after inoculation at various doses.\nHowever, parasitemia varied on days 8 and 10, and results with WATEAEF were no better\nthan with chloroquine. Additionally, treatment with 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight\nWATEAEF significantly increased (P<0.05) plasma creatinine concentration compared\nwith controls (65). Despite the reduction in\nparasitemia, the extract cannot yet be considered an appropriate treatment for\nmalaria. More studies are needed to clarify the adverse effects and effectiveness of\nthe coconut extracts, especially in infections caused by P.\nfalciparum (the main agent in humans).', 'The crude methanol extracts of 22 plants used in Mexican folk medicine were tested\nin vitro against Trichomonas vaginalis. The\nsusceptibility tests were performed using a previously described subculture method\n(66). Trophozoites (4×104) were\nincubated for 48 h at 37°C in the presence of different concentrations (2.5–200\nmg/mL) of the crude extracts in DMSO. Each test included metronidazole as a positive\ncontrol, a negative control (culture medium plus trophozoites and DMSO), and a blank\n(culture medium). The experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least\nthree times. The crude methanol extract of C. nucifera husk fiber\ndemonstrated excellent antitrichomonal activity (IC50 value of 5.8 μg/mL),\nstanding out among the other tested plants, although the activity was less than that\nof metronidazole.

Feeding these animals with tender coconut\nwater (West Coast Tall variety) protected against the induction of myocardial\ninfarction and decreased mitochondrial lipid peroxidation.', 'In another study, dietary coconut sprout (West Coast Tall variety) was tested on\nisoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats (68). There was a decrease in the levels of cardiac markers (CK-MB and\ntroponin-T) in serum of the group pretreated with coconut sprout (50, 100, or 200\nmg/100 g body weight) orally for 45 days. Rats fed with 100 mg/100 g body weight\nshowed better results than other treatment groups. In addition, pretreatment with\ncoconut sprout decreased oxidative stress in the heart and increased antioxidant\nstatus. Biochemical analyses showed that sprouts contains bioactive components, such\nas vitamins, alkaloids, and polyphenols.', 'Tender coconut water could also reduce total cholesterol, very-low density\nlipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels in serum (69). Administering coconut water (4 mL/100 g body\nweight) in male rats counteracted the increases in these substances promoted by\ncholesterol feeding.', 'The results presented here support the cardioprotective effects of coconut water. Its\nadministration could reduce oxidative stress and cell damage in animals with induced\nmyocardial infarction and reverse increases in cholesterol levels in animals fed\nhigh-fat diets. Therefore, further research is warranted on its potential use to\nprevent a second ischemic event or in the treatment of dyslipidemic states.', 'The hepatoprotective effect of tender coconut water was investigated in carbon\ntetrachloride (CCl4)-intoxicated female rats. The animals were divided\ninto three groups: normal control rats, CCl4-treated control rats, and\ntender coconut water pretreated rats intoxicated with CCl4. Carbon\ntetrachloride caused elevated serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate\npyruvate transaminase levels and also lead to liver necrosis and fatty liver, while\nrats pretreated with coconut water showed decreased activities of these enzymes\n(59). With only one report describing these\neffects, there remains room to develop studies to define the real role of C.\nnucifera in this action.', 'The antidiabetic activity of purified coconut kernel protein (CPK) was evaluated in\nalloxan-induced diabetes (150 mg/kg body weight, ip) (70). CPK was isolated from dried coconut kernel\nand administered to Sprague-Dawley rats with a semi-synthetic diet for 45 days. It\nattenuated the increase in glucose and insulin levels in these diabetic rats.\nGlycogen levels in the liver and the activities of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes\nin the serum of treated diabetic rats reverted to normal levels compared with healthy\ncontrol animals. Histopathology revealed that CPK feeding also reduced the\ndiabetes-related pancreatic damage in treated rats compared with the diabetic\ncontrol. These results are probably due to the effects of CPK on pancreatic β cell\nregeneration through arginine, an important amino acid found at high concentrations\nin CPK by HPLC.', 'The effects of mature coconut water were also evaluated and compared with\nglibenclamide in alloxan-induced diabetic rats (71). Treatment of diabetic rats with lyophilized mature coconut water\n(1000 mg/kg body weight) or glibenclamide (0.6 mg/kg body weight) reduced blood\nglucose levels (129.23±1.95 and 120±2.3 mg/dL, respectively) when compared with the\nuntreated control (275.32±4.25 mg/dL). Coconut water also increased insulin levels\nand liver glycogen concentrations and reduced glycated hemoglobin levels in diabetic\nrats. In addition, elevated levels of liver function enzymes markers like alkaline\nphosphatase, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and serum glutamate pyruvate\ntransaminase in diabetic rats were significantly reduced upon treatment with mature\ncoconut water. It was also observed that diabetic rats showed altered levels of blood\nurea, serum creatinine, and albumin, and the albumin/globulin ratio was significantly\nreversed by treatment with mature coconut water and glibenclamide.', 'Administering immature coconut inflorescence methanol extract (West Coast Tall\nvariety) to diabetic rats significantly reduced fasting glucose levels and increased\ninsulin levels compared with a diabetic control (72). The 200 mg/kg body weight dose showed better antihyperglycemic\neffects than other doses.', 'These studies demonstrated that different parts of C. nuciferacan\nbenefit diabetic rats, similar to oral hypoglycemic agents currently used clinically\nto control diabetes. Therefore, clinical trials and biochemical analyzes are\nrecommended to isolate the compounds responsible for these actions and to establish\nthem as drugs.', 'VCO was investigated in postmenopausal osteoporosis rats to determine its effects on\nbone microarchitecture (73). Rats were\nsupplemented with VCO (8% mixed with the standard rat chow diet) for 6 weeks. VCO\nadministration significantly increased bone volume, prevented a reduction in\ntrabecular number, and lowered the trabecular separation compared with the\novariectomized control. Bone histology revealed that the trabecular bones of the\novariectomized group appeared to be sparser and less dense than in the group treated\nwith VCO. Treatment of ovariectomized rats with VCO seemed to reverse the effects of\nestrogen deficiency on bone structure. With only one report on the anti-osteoporosis\nactivity of C. nucifera available, there is a need for further\nstudies.', 'The anti-hypertensive activity of an ethanolic extract of C.\nnucifera endocarp (EEC) using the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)\nsalt-induced model of hypertension was observed. Administering EEC significantly\nreduced the mean systolic blood pressure in DOCA salt-induced hypertensive rats (from\n185.3±4.7 to 145.6±6.1 mm Hg). This effect was attributed to the direct activation of\nthe nitric oxide/guanylate cyclase pathway as well as stimulation of muscarinic\nreceptors and/or the cyclooxygenase pathway. These activities can be explained by the\npresence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in the extract used (74). Based on these results, C.\nnucifera should be studied further for its potential use against\ncardiovascular diseases.', 'Several studies have investigated the toxicological properties of C.\nnucifera. One paper verified the effect of ethyl acetate extract of\nC. nucifera fiber on physiological parameters and on topical\ninflammation induced by xylene in animal models (75). Regarding the physiological parameters and macroscopic aspects of the\nlymphoid organs in this study, neither mortality nor any symptom of toxicity was\nobserved in the animals.', 'The possible toxic effects of crude extract, F1, and F2 (see above) of C.\nnucifera mesocarp were evaluated in mice (44). The oral treatment of mice over 5 days with a single dose (500 mg/kg)\ncaused no behavioral changes. No injury or bleeding stomachs were observed.', 'Another study evaluated the toxicity of a methanol extract of C.\nnucifera endocarp (25). Five female\nand five male mice received a single dose orally (5000 mg/kg) of this extract. All male\nand female rats were observed for signs of toxicity and mortality on the day of dosing;\nat 1, 3, and 4 h after administration; and then twice daily for 14 days. No signs of\ntoxicity and mortality were recorded, and all animals gained weight during the\nobservation period.', 'Acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity from liquid mesocarp of green coconut (LMGC) and\nbutanol extract obtained from the LMGC were tested in mice and rats (28). No acute lethal effects were observed in mice\nreceiving a dose of 3000 mg/kg orally of either extract. In contrast, when LMGC and\nbutanol extract were administered intraperitoneally at doses of 500 and 700 mg/kg, no\nanimal survived. In subchronic toxicity tests, the rats treated with LBGC had\nsignificantly higher white blood cell, neutrophil, red blood cell, hematocrit, and\nplatelet counts. In the chronic toxicity test, the group treated with LBGC showed higher\nvalues for neutrophils, white blood cells, basophils, and platelets (P<0.05).\nHowever, in the subchronic and chronic toxicity tests, no hematological parameters\ndiffered significantly in the group treated with butanol extract (P>0.05). Only\ntriglycerides were higher (P<0.05) in the group treated with LBGC during the chronic\ntoxicity test. Rats treated with both extracts had no histopathological changes related\nto toxicity, nor did weight gain differ between treated and control groups (P>0.05).\nIn conclusion, both extracts showed low toxicity for those parameters.', '\nCocos nucifera is a widely dispersed plant that has important\npharmacological effects with low toxicity. Furthermore, medicinal use of C.\nnucifera has an environmental appeal, since this plant is widely used in the\nfood industry and use of discarded plant parts will reduce waste and pollution. The\npharmacological effects of the plant differ according to the part of the plant or fruit\nused. Antioxidant activity predominated in the constituents of the endocarp and coconut\nwater. In addition, the fiber showed antibacterial, antiparasitic, and anti-inflammatory\nactivities. Only the ethanolic extract of the root had depressant and anticonvulsant\naction on the central nervous system. Coconut water seems to have protective effects,\ne.g., on the kidney and heart, and antioxidant activity, as well as a hypoglycemic\neffect.', 'Some limitations of the studies on C. nucifera must be acknowledged.\nFirst, the studies have focused on the effects of different parts of the plant but\nwithout demonstrating the mechanisms underlying these actions. Second, formulations\nbased on parts of the plant must be developed to conduct clinical trials.', 'Considering the diversity of pharmacological properties, future research into C.\nnucifera should be encouraged. The main goals should be to isolate specific\ncompounds, to clarify the mechanisms involved in the pharmacological effects, and to\ninvestigate possible toxic effects to produce safe phytotherapies.', 'Several factors may limit such studies. Geographical and seasonal variations among\ncountries and regions can influence the chemical composition of the studied material.\nTherefore, standardized procedures for collecting samples and quantifying compounds\nshould be used to assure the reproducibility of results.', 'This study was supported by CNPq, CAPES, and the Ceará Foundation for the support of\nscientific and technological development (FUNCAP).', 'First published online.']
