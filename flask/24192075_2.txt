['\n        Abstract\n        Exposure to improvised explosive devices can result in a unique form of traumatic brain injury—blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI). At the mild end of the spectrum (mild bTBI [mbTBI]), there are cognitive and mood disturbances. Similar symptoms have been observed in post-traumatic stress disorder caused by exposure to extreme psychological stress without physical injury. A role of the monoaminergic system in mood regulation and stress is well established but its involvement in mbTBI is not well understood. To address this gap, we used a rodent model of mbTBI and detected a decrease in immobility behavior in the forced swim test at 1\u2009d post-exposure, coupled with an increase in climbing behavior, but not after 14\u2009d or later, possibly indicating a transient increase in anxiety-like behavior. Using in situ hybridization, we found elevated messenger ribonucleic acid levels of both tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 in the locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe nucleus, respectively, as early as 2\u2009h post-exposure. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis 1\u2009d post-exposure primarily showed elevated noradrenaline levels in several forebrain regions. Taken together, we report that exposure to mild blast results in transient changes in both anxiety-like behavior and brain region–specific molecular changes, implicating the monoaminergic system in the pathobiology of mbTBI.\n      ', 'Shared senior authorship.', 'Exposure to improvised explosive devices can result in a unique form of traumatic brain injury—blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI).
