Commercial uses for these enzymes include paper manufacturing, brewing, biomass deconstruction and the production of animal feeds [1–3]. Hot springs, especially those at Yellowstone National Park, have been a source of many new organisms including Thermus aquaticus [4, 5], Thermus brockianus [6], and Acidothermus cellulolyticus [7] that possess enzymes with significant potential in biotechnological applications [8]. As part of a project in conjunction with the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, Dept. of Energy, C5-6 Technologies and Lucigen Corp. isolated, characterized, and sequenced a number of new enzyme-producing aerobic organisms from Yellowstone hot springs.', 'Geobacillus species were the most common aerobic organisms isolated during the cultivation of most hot springs samples. Geobacillus species were originally classified as members of the genus Bacillus, but were reclassified as a separate genus based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, lipid and fatty acid analysis, phenotypic characterization, and DNA–DNA hybridization experiments [9]. Geobacillus species have been isolated from a number of hostile environments including high-temperature oilfields [10], a corroded pipeline in an extremely deep well [11], African [12] and Russian [13] hot springs, marine vents [14], and the Mariana Trench [15], yet they can also be found in garden soils [16] and hay composts [17]. In many cases though, it is unclear if these isolations of Geobacillus species represent vegetative cells growing in these environments or merely spores spread from other locations [18]. The ability of Geobacillus species to thrive in varied and often hostile environments suggests that these species possess enzymes suitable for applications in hostile industrial environments. We therefor sequenced a number of these Geobacillus isolates including G. thermoglucosidasius C56-YS93 to identify new enzymes suitable for use in biomass conversion into fuels and chemicals.', 'G. thermoglucosidasius C56-YS93 is one of a number of novel thermophilic species isolated from Obsidian Hot Spring, Yellowstone National Park, Montana, USA (44.6100594° latitude and −110.4388217° longitude) under a sampling permit from the National Park Service.

Illumina data was used to correct potential base errors and increase consensus quality using a software Polisher developed at JGI (Alla Lapidus, unpublished). After the shotgun stage, reads were assembled with parallel phrap (High Performance Software, LLC). Possible mis-assemblies were corrected with gapResolution (Cliff Han, unpublished), Dupfinisher (Han, 2006), or sequencing cloned bridging PCR fragments with subcloning. Gaps between contigs were closed by editing in Consed, by PCR and by Bubble PCR primer walks.

Among the annotated proteins, the 20Kb plasmid contains an annotated P4 phage/plasmid primase with no close homologs in other Geobacillus strains (Geoth_0020) and an annotated ArpU family phage transcriptional regulator (Geoth_0016). The 20 Kb plasmid contains an annotated transcriptional modulator of MazE/toxin, MazF (Geoth_0007) that may function in maintaining the plasmid. The 80 Kb plasmid contains a gene cluster that may function for proline and hydroxyproline capture, transport and metabolism.

G. thermoglucosidasius C56-YS93 is the first G. thermoglucosidasius strain from a hot spring environment for which a whole genome sequence is available. While it is possible that G. thermoglucosidasius C56-YS93 was present only as wind-blown spores in the hot spring [18], there are a number of strong arguments for the growth of this and other Geobacillus species in hot springs. The first and most compelling argument is that, in our lab, boiled samples of Obsidian hot spring water resulted in isolation of no viable organisms, either in liquid culture or by plating. If Geobacillus spores were present in a significant quantity, a significant number of isolates would be expected. Secondly, we have been able to isolate Geobacillus species only from alkaline or neutral hot springs with temperatures between 60 and 80\xa0°C, essentially the environment in which Geobacillus species can grow. No Geobacillus species were isolated from acidic hot springs located close to the alkaline and neutral springs. The isolation of wind-borne spore cultures would predict equal numbers of Geobacillus species isolated from acidic and alkaline springs. Thirdly, in our work, Geobacillus species and Thermus species were the predominant organisms isolated from Yellowstone hot springs under aerobic conditions. Thermus species share temperature and pH optima with Geobacillus species. Thermus species do not sporulate, so the presence of Thermus species cannot be attributed to wind-blown spores, but indicates the organism is growing in the hot spring. If these hot springs support growth of Thermus species, it would be difficult to argue that the hot springs can support growth of Thermus species but cannot support growth of with Geobacillus species. Finally, Geobacillus species have been isolated from microbial mats from other hot springs in Yellowstone [44].', 'G. thermoglucosidasius, C56-YS93, appears to have a number of unique features as a result of its growth in the hot spring environment. The organism possesses a large xylan degradation cluster that increases the substrate range of this strain relative to the other two sequenced strains. A number of other biomass-degrading organisms have been identified in Obsidian Hot Spring [45], but this is the first reported biomass-degrading Geobacillus species from the hot spring. The organization of this cluster appears to match the glucuronic acid utilization cluster described for G. stearothermophilus [40], suggesting this cluster may be conserved in other Geobacillus species. G. thermoglucosidasius C56-YS93 possesses both chromosomal and plasmid-borne peptide utilization clusters that may allow the organism to scavenge proteins and peptides from the medium. G. thermoglucosidasius C56-YS93 also possesses the ability to reduce nitrate to dinitrogen, possibly utilizing nitrate as an alternate electron acceptor in the oxygen-poor high temperature environment. Genetic exchange with other Geobacillus species in the hot spring may be facilitated by the presence of the two plasmids not found in the other two strains. Further work is needed to identify the function of the genes present on these two plasmids and clarify the role they play in survival in the hot spring. Metagenomic analysis of samples from two other hot springs in Yellowstone National Park, Bear Paw and Octopus, shows the presence of active archaeal and bacterial phage populations [46, 47]. The prophage identified in G. thermoglucosidasius C56-YS93 (43.9\xa0%\xa0G\u2009+\u2009C) is unrelated to the prophages identified in Geobacillus species Y412MC52 and Y412MC61 (52.3\xa0%\xa0G\u2009+\u2009C), isolated from the same hot spring. This suggests that the identified prophage identified in G. thermoglucosidasius C56-YS93 may be specific to G. thermoglucosidasius, or to the lower G\u2009+\u2009C species. Additional work is needed to understand the relationship between Geobacillus species and the phages that infect them.', '\n            \n              Additional file 1: Table S1.\n              \n                Associated MIGS record.\n              \n            \n          ', 'Associated MIGS record.', 'Integrate microbial genomes database', 'Joint Genome Institute', '\n          Competing interests\n        ', 'The authors declare that they have no competing interests.', '\n          Authors’ contributions\n        ', 'PJB isolated and characterized the organism and wrote the manuscript, DAM managed the hot spring sampling, DNA preparation and submission to JGI for sequencing, and MLL did the genome annotation and document editing.
