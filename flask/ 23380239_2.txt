['\n        Background and Aims Seedling herbivory is an important factor underlying plant community diversity and structure. While considerable research has characterized seedling defence in terms of resistance, very little is known about seedling tolerance of herbivory. Moreover, few studies have attempted to identify mechanisms of tolerance across a range of plant species.\n        Methods Seedling tolerance of simulated herbivory was tested in a diverse pool of ten Hawaiian plant species, including several lobeliad species (family Campanulaceae), a grass, a herb and common woody trees and shrubs. Tolerance was measured as the relative survival and growth of damaged plants receiving 50\xa0% defoliation with simultaneous jasmonic acid application compared with undamaged control plants, assessed 1·5 and 5\xa0weeks after damage. Putative mechanisms of tolerance were measured, including photosynthetic parameters, light use efficiency, and biomass allocation reflecting growth priorities, and analysed using species-level regression analyses on tolerance indices.\n        Key Results No species fully tolerated 50\xa0% defoliation at either harvest date, and simulated herbivory significantly reduced shoot as well as root biomass. Lobeliad species had particularly low tolerance. Species varied considerably in size, biomass allocation parameters and their constitutive (pre-damage) and induced (post-damage) photosynthetic parameters. However, only constitutive levels of non-photochemical quenching were significantly related to tolerance, indicating that species with more efficient light use (and less heat dissipation) are better at tolerating damage than species with high levels of heat dissipation.\n        Conclusions Native Hawaiian plants expressed low tolerance to a conservative level of simulated herbivory. Root growth decreased in response to damage, but this was not associated with greater tolerance, suggesting this response may be due to allocation constraints following defoliation and not due to adaptive plasticity. Conservation of native island plants threatened by invasive herbivores should prioritize protection for seedlings for improved regeneration and the persistence of native plants in disturbed habitats.\n      ', 'Background and Aims Seedling herbivory is an important factor underlying plant community diversity and structure.
